## User Panels

Include custom panels in this folder. See `../panels/` for example code.

User panels allow you to add new functionality to Visum without needing to poke around at the internals. Simply follow the Typescript contract (WIP) to return:
* A panel component
* A preview (for in the panel browser)
* A toolbar (for passing options to your panel)
