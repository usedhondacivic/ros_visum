# ROS Visum

An extendable ROS dashboard uniting disparate open source visualization tools.

Combines the following:
* From the [Robot Web Tools Project](https://robotwebtools.github.io/)
    * [ros3djs](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/ros3djs)
    * [ros2djs](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/ros2djs)
* From the [Gazebo Project](https://gazebosim.org/home)
    * [gzweb](https://github.com/gazebo-web/gzweb)

Inspired by [Foxglove Studio](https://foxglove.dev/), and their [decision to go closed source](https://foxglove.dev/blog/foxglove-2-0-unifying-robotics-observability#discontinuing-foxglove-studio-open-source).
